## Slide 5: 🌟 Feature #1: Transparent Diagnosis

**Real doctors explain their thinking. So does PixelCare.**

```
You: "Doctor, should I be worried about my heart rate?"

🩺 DOCTOR'S REASONING (Visible):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Examining vital signs...                │
│ ✓ Heart rate: 68→73 BPM (mild increase)│
│ ✓ HRV: 45ms SDNN (moderate stress)     │
│ ✓ Breathing: 16 BPM (normal)           │
│ ✓ Blood pressure: Not measured         │
│                                         │
│ Clinical assessment:                    │
│ • Increase is within normal range      │
│ • Likely stress-related (HRV confirms) │
│ • No immediate concern                 │
│ • Monitor if symptoms persist          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

💬 SECOND OPINION:
"Your heart rate increase from 68 to 73 BPM is normal 
and likely stress-related. Your HRV confirms mild stress. 
This is not concerning, but if you experience chest pain, 
shortness of breath, or palpitations, consult your 
primary doctor immediately."
```

## Slide 6: 🌟 Feature #2: Medical Report Analysis

**Upload any health document - Get expert second opinion**

📄 You upload: Blood Test Report

🩺 DOCTOR'S ANALYSIS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Reviewing lab results...                │
│                                         │
│ Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL                  │
│ ├─ Normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL       │
│ ├─ Status: Slightly low                │
│ └─ Clinical significance: Mild anemia  │
│                                         │
│ Correlating with current vitals:       │
│ ├─ Low HRV detected (fatigue marker)   │
│ ├─ Normal heart rate                   │
│ └─ Consistent with mild anemia         │
│                                         │
│ Cross-referencing symptoms:             │
│ └─ Fatigue, low energy confirmed       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

💬 SECOND OPINION:
"Your hemoglobin is slightly low (12.5 vs normal 13.5+), 
indicating mild anemia. This explains your fatigue. 

Recommendations:
1. Increase iron-rich foods (spinach, red meat, lentils)
2. Consider iron supplement (consult your doctor first)
3. Retest in 4-6 weeks
4. See doctor if symptoms worsen

When to seek immediate care:
• Severe fatigue or weakness
• Shortness of breath
• Chest pain"
